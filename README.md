### **Microapps You Could Include**
1. **LAN Wiring & Network Disconnections** – Simulate common networking issues like cable faults, misconfigured duplex settings, and incorrect VLAN assignments.
2. **Routing & Switch Discovery Algorithms** – Implement algorithms like RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, and spanning tree protocol (STP) while visualizing packet flow dynamically.
3. **Subnetting & IP Addressing Trainer** – Generate random subnetting exercises and validate user-provided solutions with real-time feedback.
4. **Firewall & ACL Configuration Simulator** – Allow users to set firewall rules and access control lists, then simulate packet behavior based on defined rules.
5. **Packet Sniffing & Traffic Analysis** – A virtual packet capture tool where users can inspect HTTP, TCP, ICMP, and other traffic in real time.
6. **Network Troubleshooting Scenarios** – Present various scenarios with broken configurations that the user needs to diagnose and fix.
7. **Network Automation & API Testing** – Simulate network automation tasks using REST APIs commonly used with SDN.
8. **Security Attacks & Mitigation Trainer** – Simulate network attacks (e.g., ARP spoofing, DoS, rogue DHCP) and let users practice mitigation strategies.
9. **Wireless Networking Simulator** – Show Wi-Fi interference, channel overlapping, and roaming scenarios for practice.
10. **BGP & Advanced Routing Visualization** – Allow users to visualize BGP route advertisements and path selection.

### **Additional Issues & Scenarios**
1. **Load Balancer Failures** – Simulate uneven traffic distribution, failed health checks, or incorrect server weights.
2. **DHCP Troubleshooting** – Introduce misconfigured DHCP scopes, IP conflicts, or rogue DHCP servers.
3. **DNS Resolution Errors** – Simulate broken DNS records, high latency DNS queries, or incorrect caching issues.
4. **NAT & Port Forwarding Issues** – Simulate misconfigured NAT rules, double NAT problems, or incorrect port forwarding settings.
5. **VPN Connectivity & Tunneling** – Emulate site-to-site VPN failures, broken encryption settings, or mismatched security parameters.
6. **QoS Misconfigurations** – Show bandwidth misallocations, traffic prioritization failures, or DSCP mismatches.
7. **SDN Controller & API Issues** – Allow users to debug broken SDN configurations, unreachable controllers, or misconfigured intents.
8. **IPv6 Transition Problems** – Simulate broken IPv6 tunnels, incorrect dual-stack configurations, or failed Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP).
9. **Cloud Networking & Hybrid Connectivity** – Model cloud interconnects, broken VPN-to-cloud links, and latency bottlenecks.
10. **Wireless Networking Troubleshooting** – Introduce Wi-Fi interference issues, signal degradation, and incorrect security settings.
